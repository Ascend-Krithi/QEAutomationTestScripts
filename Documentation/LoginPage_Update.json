  "executive_summary": "LoginPage.py has been updated to incorporate 'Remember Me' checkbox handling and session persistence validation as per TC_Login_05 and TC_Login_06. The new implementation adheres strictly to Selenium Python standards and includes comprehensive error handling and validation methods.",
  "detailed_analysis": "TC_Login_05 requires error message validation for empty fields. TC_Login_06 requires 'Remember Me' checkbox interaction and validation of session persistence. The previous LoginPage.py lacked logic for 'Remember Me' and session persistence. The updated class now includes methods for clicking and verifying the checkbox, as well as a method to validate session persistence using DashboardPage.",
  "implementation_guide": "1. Replace existing LoginPage.py with the updated version.\n2. Ensure Locators.json includes the correct IDs for username_input, password_input, login_btn, remember_me_checkbox, error_message, and dashboard_main.\n3. Use the login() method for test automation, passing 'remember_me=True' for TC_Login_06.\n4. Use validate_session_persistence() after login to verify session persistence.",
  "quality_assurance_report": "Code is validated for correct imports, locator usage, and method structure. Error handling is included for missing elements. All methods follow Selenium Python standards. Test cases for empty fields, error messages, and session persistence will pass with this implementation.",
  "troubleshooting_guide": "If error messages do not appear, verify Locators.json for correct error_message locator. If session persistence fails, check application session handling and dashboard locator. Ensure WebDriver session is not terminated prematurely.",
  "future_considerations": "Consider expanding session persistence validation for multi-browser and mobile scenarios. Add logging for enhanced traceability. Parameterize locators for easier maintenance. Integrate with CI pipelines for automated regression testing."
