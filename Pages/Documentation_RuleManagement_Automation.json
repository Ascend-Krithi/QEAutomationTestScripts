  "executive_summary": "This implementation introduces two new Selenium PageClasses, LoginPage.py and RuleManagementPage.py, to automate end-to-end rule definition and deposit simulation based on provided test cases. All locators are strictly referenced from Locators.json or placeholder values for UI elements not defined. The solution is ready for downstream integration and adheres to enterprise code quality standards.",
  "detailed_analysis": "Analysis of test cases TC-FT-005 and TC-FT-006 revealed requirements for rule definition, deposit simulation, and validation of rule acceptance/rejection. Existing PageClasses were not found in the repository, necessitating creation of new classes. Locators.json was referenced for LoginPage.py, while RuleManagementPage.py uses placeholder locators for rule management actions.",
  "implementation_guide": "1. Add LoginPage.py and RuleManagementPage.py to the repository.\n2. Use LoginPage.py for authentication workflows as per Locators.json.\n3. Use RuleManagementPage.py for defining rules, simulating deposits, and validating outcomes.\n4. Update locators in RuleManagementPage.py as per actual UI elements.\n5. Integrate these classes in your Selenium test suites to automate the described test cases.",
  "quality_assurance_report": "- All imports validated.\n- Code follows Python Selenium best practices.\n- No existing logic was altered; new code was added.\n- Locators strictly referenced or clearly marked as placeholders.\n- Output is structured and validated as JSON array for downstream agents.",
  "troubleshooting_guide": "- If locators in RuleManagementPage.py do not match the UI, update them accordingly.\n- Ensure WebDriver instance is correctly passed to PageClass constructors.\n- For login failures, validate credentials and locator accuracy.\n- For rule definition errors, check for UI changes or missing fields.",
  "future_considerations": "- Update RuleManagementPage.py with actual locators once UI is finalized.\n- Extend PageClasses for additional rule types and actions as business logic evolves.\n- Integrate with CI/CD for automated regression testing.\n- Add error handling and logging for robustness."
