{"executive_summary": "The RuleConfigurationPage.py class has been updated to support TC_SCRUM158_01 and TC_SCRUM158_02. All new methods strictly preserve existing logic and append functionality for rule creation, empty conditions, and triggering. Locators are validated against Locators.json, and code is ready for downstream automation.", "quality_assurance": "All updates maintain strict code integrity. Existing methods are untouched, new methods are appended. Locators are referenced as per Locators.json. Each method includes docstrings. UI waits are used for reliability.", "troubleshooting_guide": "If test fails, verify locators in Locators.json match UI, ensure correct test data is passed, and confirm backend retrieval logic is implemented if required.", "future_considerations": "Consider parameterizing locators for flexibility, implement error handling for UI interaction failures, and expand backend retrieval logic for validation."}
