{"executive_summary": "The TransferAPIPage.py PageClass has been updated to handle extra fields in transfer payloads (TC-158-05) and to robustly detect and report malformed JSON (TC-158-06). These enhancements ensure strict code integrity and improve downstream automation reliability.", "analysis": "TC-158-05 requires that extra fields in the transfer payload be ignored or logged. The updated PageClass now logs extra fields for audit purposes. TC-158-06 requires detection of malformed JSON; the updated PageClass now catches JSON serialization and decoding errors and returns a structured error.", "implementation_guide": "Replace TransferAPIPage.py with the updated version. For TC-158-05, use submit_transfer with a payload containing extra fields (such as 'note') and verify that extra_fields_logged contains the extra field. For TC-158-06, use submit_transfer with a malformed payload (simulate by passing a string or causing serialization error) and verify error_message is 'Invalid JSON format'.", "qa_report": "Tested submit_transfer with extra fields: transfer succeeds, extra_fields_logged contains 'note'. Tested submit_transfer with malformed JSON: error_message is 'Invalid JSON format', status_code is 400.", "troubleshooting": "If extra fields are not logged, check REQUIRED_FIELDS definition and payload structure. If malformed JSON is not detected, ensure payload is not already a valid dict and test with actual malformed input.", "future_considerations": "Consider expanding logging for extra fields to backend audit systems and adding more granular JSON schema validation. Ensure error handling covers all common API failure modes."}
